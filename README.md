# Portfolio

## Description

The motivation of this project was to make a functioning, responsive portfolio webpage that is current with Web Development standards from scratch. Through this project I gained a deeper understanding of flexbox and how it interacts with  non-perfect images on a page. Using media queries, I also learned how to create a responsive navigation bar.
