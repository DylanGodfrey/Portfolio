# Portfolio

## Description

The motivation of this project was to make a functioning, responsive portfolio webpage that is current with Web Development standards. Through this project I gained a deeper understanding of flexbox and how it interacts with  non-perfect images on a page. Using media queries, I also learned how to create a responsive navigation bar.  

take an existing website and refactor its code to bring it up to current web development standards including making the site accessable to screen readers. Through this project I learned the value of semantic tags and how to use class and id tags to increase the value of web files without changing the unchanged webpage.
